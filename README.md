## About
Here at Microsoft, we are very excited about serverless technologies and all the many ways people have of leveraging the cloud to scale their businesses. Microsoft Azure, for example, can “turn ideas into solutions with more than 100 services to build, deploy, and manage applications—in the cloud, on-premises, and at the edge—using the tools and frameworks of your choice.”

We’re launching 25 Days of Serverless as a way for you to explore – any way you like – the promise and potential of serverless technologies. Over the month of December, you’ll be able to tackle all kinds of challenges that you can solve any way you like; we’ll offer solutions built on Azure, of course, but we’re curious how you would approach the problems we will present to you.

We look forward to your submissions!

## The Premise
Oh no! An evil grinch has stolen all of the world's servers! Travel around the world helping everyone replace their current solutions to common tasks with serverless technology in time for the holiday rush.

Each day's puzzle will bring you to a new location somewhere in the world! You'll be helping local folks in that location with some problem they have, showing how moving to serverless can help things get done!
